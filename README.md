## Personal Webpage Using Bootstrap

This is a single-page personal website created for the Web Design Principles class. The page introduces me, my hobbies, and my personal goals. It is built using **Bootstrap 5** to ensure a mobile-responsive and professional layout.

### Features & Components Used

- **Navbar (responsive)**: Collapsible on mobile devices, includes links to sections on the page.
- **Bootstrap Grid System**: Used for layout and responsive columns in each section.
- **Cards**: Used in the "Hobbies" section to showcase photography, traveling, and cooking.
- **Buttons**: Used for call-to-action in the "About Me" and "My Goals" sections.
- **Spacing Utilities**: `my-5`, `mb-3`, `py-5` etc., used for consistent margins and paddings.
- **Responsive Images**: `img-fluid` class ensures all images scale correctly on different screen sizes.

2. **Hobbies**: Three hobbies highlighted using Bootstrap cards (Photography, Traveling, Cooking).
3. **My Goals**: Personal learning and creative goals, highlighting growth and hobbies rather than strictly professional career aspirations.
